                  It digitalizes the entire process of consultation by noting
                  down the User's symptoms and preparing a Medical Report on
                  basis of that, which is then sent to the Doctor. The Doctor
                  can further manage his Patient Records, Clinic Data through
                  the App and also provide Digital Prescriptions to the
                  consulted patients.

                <p>
                  This is an IoT enabled device that uses Machine Learning to
                  type out text/audio messages with hand gestures. The gesture
                  keyboard module consists of an Arduino Nano micro-processor
                  with an MPU-6050 attached to it. It captures the movement of
                  the module through its 6 axes and compares it against the
                  1500+ samples that we have recorded beforehand and predicts
                  the correct character. For this purpose We use pyGARL, a
                  Python library which uses SVM algorithms.
